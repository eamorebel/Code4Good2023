## Model and Applications

Introducing our cutting-edge object detection model powered by YOLOv8, specifically designed to enhance classroom education and address the growing concern of prohibited device usage among students. Our advanced technology automatically identifies and alerts educators to the presence of phones and other forbidden devices within the classroom. By utilizing real-time object detection capabilities, we empower educators to effortlessly monitor and maintain a focused learning environment. With this innovative solution, educators can proactively address distractions, promote student engagement, and uphold classroom rules. Experience the power of our model in revolutionizing classroom management and fostering an optimal learning atmosphere. Together, let's create an environment where students can thrive and reach their full educational potential.

## Real World Implementation

By deploying strategically positioned cameras in the classroom, the model can actively scan the environment, detect and identify instances where students are using prohibited devices. When such devices are detected, the model can trigger real-time alerts or notifications, enabling educators to promptly address the situation and enforce appropriate discipline measures. The implementation of this model in real-world classrooms can effectively discourage unauthorized device usage, foster a focused learning environment, and promote better engagement among students, ultimately enhancing the overall educational experience.
